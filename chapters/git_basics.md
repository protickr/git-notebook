# What is git

git is a distributed version control system that enables us to control versions of a project by tracking different versions of it
It generally keep track of all the commits (chunk of change) that we make to a project and lets us traverse through them and also move backward or forward at will.

Distributed version control system is different from Centralized version control system as DVCS allows user to have an updated copy of the whole repository and CVCS allows user to have only a version of the project.
