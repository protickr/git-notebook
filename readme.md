# git notebook to future-self

This project is result of personal practice on git to understand and experience git hands on in using a terminal.
Attempted to document what I have learned through practice and tutorials.
This is not a exhaustive list of commands and descriptions of version control system nor git.
Also to make this note I have learned and used mark-down markup language.
In seperate project with separate repository all markdown syntax that I have learned so far will be documented.
index.md page holds navigation links to separate segments of this project.
